####created by [Nuatu Tseggai] (https://github.com/Nuatu) July 14th, 2014

Simple javascript app that takes any number between 0 and 99 and returns the corresponding amount of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, as processed by a "least" function.

For added fun, this app will also tell you a randomized amount of change that is equal to the number you input, as processed by a randomized function (that runs through 4 cycles of randomness).

App accepts:

-any number between 0 and 99

App returns:

-the least amount of change that adds up to the number

-randomized change that adds up to the number

      <h3>Enter any number between 0 and 99, and this app will tell you the corresponding amount of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, as processed by a "least" function I coded. For shit's and giggles, this app will also tell you a randomized amount of change that is equal to the number you input, as processed by a randomized function (that I setup to run through more than a few times per submission, for extra randomness and such!</h3>
